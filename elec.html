            If you have a smart meter for your electricity, you can request your electricity retailer or wholesaler for
            the historical data from it.
            The data is power to and from the grid over regular intervals, such as every 5, 15 or 30 mins
            and is provided in a CSV file conforming to the NEM12 specification by AMEO.
        </p>
        <p>
            This tool will calculate the power used in each tariff band and the cost under the specified tariffs.
            It handles fixed and time of use (TOU) tariffs and solar feed-in.
            All processing is done in your browser and your data never leaves your computer.

            <h2>Potential Uses:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>check you are being charged correctly by your retailer;
                <li>compare alternative tariffs (be sure to treat GST in the same way for all tariffs);
                <li>learn the sigificance of the different aspects of tariffs:
                    <ul>
                        <li>high peak usage may favour a flat tariff and low peak usage may favour a time of use tariff;
                        <li>low usage may favour accepting higher usage charges in exchange for a lower daily supply charge;
                        <li>it may be worth accepting lower feed-in tariffs in exchange for minimizing other charges (especially if you can use the power you generate yourself);
                        <li>a tariff that charges public holidays at Sunday rates may save you less than you might hope (likewise for gimmicks like reward points).
                    </ul>  
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div></div>
        <p>
            The rules for Peak Demand tariffs appear to vary greatly between retailers/wholesalers/states and these are not handled.
            Peak Demand tariffs are too complex for residential customers generally and never should have been offerred to them, let alone switched to automatically.
            Avoid them.

    <h2>Tariff</h2>
    <div id="tariff">
        <p>
            You need to provide your tariff information in a CSV (comma separated values) file.
            You can download and use this <a href="data/redEnergy2024TouTariff.csv" target="_blank">Red Energy 2024 TOU tariff</a> for a demo then modify it for your own tariff.
            It is mostly self explanatory, but the row labelled "Daily" has a different format from the other rows and warrants further <a id="openDailyExplanation">explanation</a>.
        </p>
        <div id="dailyExplanation" class="jw-modal"><div class="jw-modal-body">
            <h2>Special rules for the "Daily" row in the tariff CSV file:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Retail tariffs use local time (including daylight savings if in effect), whereas NEM12 files always use AEST (not daylight savings time).
                    So we need to know the timezone for the tariff so that we can convert from NEM12 AEST to the local time applicable for the tariff. 
                    The IANA timezone e.g. "Australia/Sydney" is put in the "Time Start" column of the "Daily" row.
                <li>Some tariffs charge public holidays at Sunday rates (only tariffs which explicitly say so). In this case the 2 or 3 letter state abreviation e.g. "NSW" is put
                    in the "Time End" column of the "Daily" row.
                    "N/A" is used if the tariff does not charge public holidays at Sunday rates.
                    The included public holiday data was sourced from data.gov.au and covers 2021-2025 (inclusive). Unfortunately it is no longer maintained for future years.
                <li>Finally, the Daily Supply Charge ($/day) is put in the "$/kWh" column of the "Daily" row.
            </ol>
